# Event Data Enquiries

This repository is used to track enquiries about Crossref Event Data. For example, if you think a particular webpage or Tweet should have been captured but you can't find it in the Event Data Query API.

## How it works

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/CrossRef/event-data-enquiries/issues/new). Paste the URL as the title of the issue. If you want you can describe the issue.

Tag the issue with a label:

 - `missing-event` if the URL should have been captured in an Event.
 - `suggested-newsfeed` if you have found an RSS newsfeed that should be traced.
 - `suggested-website` if you have found a website that you think we should track.
 
We will perform some automatic and some manual checks.
